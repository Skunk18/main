## Background

The history of "Innovation" in the Jewish community dates back to ABC. In our modern times - post-WWII North America - we have seen varied attemps to define, orchestrate, collaborate on, and drive innovation. Organization, projects, and adhoc experiments were all started in good faith with different aims, KPIs, and audiences.

Forstering innovation can be seen through multiple lenses and at various focus points. Either you are concerned with systematic change or the target is highly focused. Either way. ther initial phase of most "innovation" in this world typically start with exploring how new or outside models, technologies, or philosophies can be applied to seek these changes.
